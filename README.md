CakeCAS
=======

This is a simple plugin for making phpCAS work with CakePHP. Just put this file in the Controller/Component/Auth/ folder and anywhere you are using the Auth component you can use ```$this->Auth->authenticate = array('Cas');```

Make sure to have [phpCAS](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASC/phpCAS) installed in the Vendor folder before trying to make this work.  

If you want to contribute or have ideas to make this better, let me know and/or submit a pull request.
